One of PvD's best tracks. I first picked up the vinyl while I was traveling and stopped by a local record store in Eugene Oregon in 1999 or 2000\. I didn't even listen to it until I got home and dropped the needle... I was floored at how good it was and put it into the rotation at Katwok in Ashland during my residency there. It never failed to drive the crowd and I think it still has the same impact today as it did then.
